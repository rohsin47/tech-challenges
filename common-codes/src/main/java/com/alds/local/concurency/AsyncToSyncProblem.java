 * Problem statement : Imagine we have an AsyncExecutor class that performs some useful task asynchronously via the method execute(). In addition, the method accepts a function object that acts as a callback 
 * and gets invoked after the asynchronous execution is done. The asynchronous work is simulated using sleep. A passed-in call is invoked to let the invoker take any desired action after the asynchronous 
 * processing is complete.Your task is to make the execution synchronous without changing the original classes (imagine that you are given the binaries and not the source code) so that the main thread waits 
 * till the asynchronous execution is complete.
